### ✨ Fun Stuff ✨
- I tend to pick up a new fitness hobby every couple months (right now is ~~weightlifting~~ ~~pickleball~~ ~~pilates~~ basketball)
- Currently catching up with all the books I neglected curing my time at college (see my recently revived Goodreads [here](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146650200-trinity)!)
- I'm a huge Pokémon fan; guess my favorite Pokémon if you happen to shoot me an email
